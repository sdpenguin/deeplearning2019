# deeplearning2019
A set of Python modules and Keras models for use in the Deep Learning 2019 coursework.

## How to Run

1. Download this git repository and run the ``init.sh`` file using ``bash``. This will download the HPatches dataset to the folder 
to your computer, as well as another repository by MatchLab-Imperial called ``keras_triplet_descriptor``. It will run two setup
files that install the current repository and the ``keras_triplet_descriptor`` repository as Python packages so that they are
globally accessible.
2. Run ``python dl2019/main.py`` with the required arguments. You can find out what is needed using the corresponding help ``python dl2019/main.py -h``.
